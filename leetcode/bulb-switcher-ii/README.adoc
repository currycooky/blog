There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:

Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).
Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).
Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).
You must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.

Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses.

class Solution {
    public int flipLights(int n, int presses) {
        if (presses == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (n == 1) {
            return 2;
        } else if (n == 2) {
            return presses == 1 ? 3 : 4;
        } else {
            //n >= 3
            if (presses == 1) {
                return 4;
            }
            if (presses == 2) {
                return 7;
            }
            return 8;
